 #downregulated is = low rate of change(less receptors)
 #upregulated is = high rate of change(more receptors)
 #In the biological context of organisms' production of gene products
 #downregulation is the process by which a cell decreases the quantity of a cellular component,
 #such as RNA or protein, in response to an external stimulus. 
 #The complementary process that involves increases of such components is called upregulation.
